# Dependency Scan

This project runs `yarn|npm audit`, `yarn|npm outdated`, `composer outdated` and `symfony security:check` and uploads the KPIs to a Google Spreadsheet.

## KPIs

Using yarn and composer this tool checks for the following KPIs:

- Outdated Patches: Number of dependencies where patch version differs from the latest version
- Outdated Minor: Number of dependencies where minor version differs from the latest version
- Outdated Major: Number of dependencies where major version differs from the latest version
- Security Issues Info: Number of security issues with a info level
- Security Issues Low: Number of security issues with a low level
- Security Issues Moderate: Number of security issues with a moderate level
- Security Issues High: Number of security issues with a high level
- Security Issues Critical: Number of security issues with a critical level

## Project Setup

Make sure you have [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed.

Then run `pipenv install`. To execute the `main.py` script you can either run `pipenv run python main.py` or run `pipenv shell` to load the pipenv environment into your shell.

## Usage

Skip 1-4 if you don't want to write the KPIs to a spreadsheet.

1. Create a new Spreadsheet and add the following columns
   > Date, Outdated Patches, Outdated Minor, Outdated Major, Security Issues Info, Security Issues Low, Security Issues Moderate, Security Issues High, Security Issues Critical
2. Enable Google Sheets API and create an OAuth2 key: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
3. Fetch the executeable from the releases
4. Download the credentials, name the file `credentials.json` and put it in the folder of the executeable
5. Ensure the binaries are installed and in the projects folder
6. Run the script with the arguments below 

For the first run uploading to a spreadsheet Google might ask you to open a browser and allow the requests.

```
./dependency-scan -i <SPREADSHEET_ID> -s <SHEET_NAME> -p <path> -y -c
```

### Docker

To use the docker container `wbgrs/dependency-scan` run the following command and add the parameters you need.

```
docker run \
   --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/,target=/app \
   --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/credentials.json,target=/script/credentials.json \
   --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/token.json,target=/script/token.json \
   wbgrs/dependency-scan \
   pipenv run python main.py -p /app
```

#### Build the Docker Container

1. Run with PHP7.2 `docker build -t wbgrs/dependency-scan .` or with PHP7.4 `docker build -f Dockerfile.php74 -t wbgrs/dependency-scan .`
2. Push it via `docker push wbgrs/dependency-scan`

### Arguments

```
-i|--spreadsheet_id <ID>    Google Spreadhsheet ID (Optional, omit if you don't want to send it to Google Spreedsheet)
-s|--sheet <NAME>           Sheet Name to add the data to (Optional, omit if you don't want to send it to Google Spreedsheet)
-p|--project <Path>         Project Folder to check (Optional)
-y|--yarn-audit             Run yarn audit (Optional)
-n|--npm-audit              Run npm audit (Optional)
-c|--composer-audit         Run composer audit (Optional)
--yarn-bin                  Path to yarn binary (Optional, defaults to "yarn")
--npm-bin                   Path to npm binary (Optional, defaults to "npm")
--composer-bin              Path to composer binary (Optional, defaults to "composer")
--symfony-bin      Path to symfony CLI binary (Optional, defaults to "symfony")
```

## Build

Run `pyinstaller --onefile -n dependency-scan main.py`. This will build the executeable for your machine.

## Troubleshooting

> UserWarning: Cannot access token.json: No such file or directory

Please create an empty `token.json` file in the folder of the executable.
